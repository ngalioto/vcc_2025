# Virutal cell challenge 2025

Testing a simple linear baseline on the [virtual cell challenge](https://virtualcellchallenge.org/).

The baseline comes from this [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02772-6) claiming simple linear baselines still outperform deep-learning models. This baseline ranked 1,022 in VCC 2025.
